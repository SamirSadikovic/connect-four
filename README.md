Connect-Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players take turns dropping pieces into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own pieces.

The project was done as part of the Programming Languages course at International Burch University, and implemented in the Ruby programming language.
